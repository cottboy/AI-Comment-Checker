Using AI large language models to automatically detect and filter spam comments, supporting APIs compatible with the OpenAI format.

== Description ==

AI Comment Checker uses AI large language models to automatically detect and filter spam comments.

= Features =

* Supports any API compatible with the OpenAI format
* Customizable AI prompts to adjust scoring criteria based on the characteristics of the website
* Configurable score thresholds for flexible control over filtering intensity
* Detailed logging to track the processing of each comment

= Workflow =

1. Visitor submits a comment
2. The plugin intercepts the comment and sends it to the AI for scoring
3. The AI returns a score between 0 and 100 (0 = spam, 100 = high quality)
4. The comment is automatically processed based on the score and threshold:
   * Score >= threshold: approved
   * Score < threshold: moved to spam or moved to moderation based on settings
   * Timeout/error: moved to moderation or directly approved based on settings
5. Detailed logs are recorded for administrators to review

= Default system prompt in the current version =

`
You are a spam comment detection system. Your ONLY task is to output a single number between 0 and 100.

SCORING RULES:
- 0-20: Obvious spam (ads, malicious links, gibberish)
- 21-40: Likely spam (suspicious links, bot-like comments)
- 41-60: Uncertain (short comments, borderline content)
- 61-80: Likely legitimate (relevant, thoughtful)
- 81-100: Clearly legitimate (detailed, helpful, on-topic)

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Output ONLY a number (0-100)
2. NO explanations
3. NO additional text
4. NO punctuation
5. Just the number

Example valid outputs: 85
Example INVALID outputs: "Score: 85", "85 points", "I think it's 85"

If you output anything other than a single number, the system will fail.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it require payment? =

The plugin itself is free, but you need an AI API key. Most AI API services require payment based on the number of tokens used.

= Where will the comment data be sent? =

Comment data will be sent to the API you configure for scoring. Make sure to use a trusted API provider and review its privacy policy. The plugin itself does not collect or store any data on third-party servers.

= How much additional wait time will be added when submitting a comment? =

It adds about 5 seconds, depending on the service provider and model used. Using a non-thinking model can effectively reduce wait time.

= What should I do if the request still fails after all options are configured? =

Check whether /v1/chat/completions is added after the API endpoint.
